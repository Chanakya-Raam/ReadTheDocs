Introduction
============

FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+.

In this project, we integrate FastAPI with Keycloak, an open-source Identity and Access Management (IAM) solution. Keycloak provides user authentication and authorization through various protocols like OpenID Connect and OAuth2.

This documentation will guide you through:

- Setting up Keycloak authentication with FastAPI
- Writing and understanding API endpoints
- Frequently asked questions

#### Why FastAPI and Keycloak?
- **FastAPI**: For high performance, asynchronous, Python-based APIs.
- **Keycloak**: For secure authentication, authorization, and user management.
